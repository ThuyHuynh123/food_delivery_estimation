# 🍔 Food Delivery Duration Estimation

This project uses machine learning to predict food delivery times based on real-world data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).

## 🚀 Project Overview

> The goal is to estimate delivery duration from various features such as restaurant location, traffic, delivery distance, etc.  
> A finely tuned LightGBM model achieves an accuracy where predictions are on average **only 13% off** the actual values!
